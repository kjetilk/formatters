Formatter-HTML-HTML version 0.97
================================

This module conforms to the Formatter API Specification, version
0.95. The specification itself can be found in the Formatter module on
CPAN. 

This Formatter is intended to be used to clean up existing HTML from
various sources. To do this, it lets HTML::Tidy do the
work. HTML::Tidy again, lets libtidy do the hard work. libtidy is the
HTML clean-up code Dave Raggett at W3C started. Pretty hefty stuff! 

INSTALLATION

To install this module use the cpan or cpanplus tools or type the
following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

TODO

One test currently depends on having the same version of tidy as the
developer. That is due to tidy inserting a version string and stuff as
a meta element in the document code, and I'm not aware of any way to
turn it off. This test is marked as TODO, but you shouldn't be
surprised to see it report that it unexpectedly succeeded.

DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on HTML::Tidy, v 1.06, and HTML::Parser to do its
hard work.

SUBVERSION REPOSITORY 

This module is currently maintained in a Subversion repository. The
trunk can be checked out anonymously using e.g.:
